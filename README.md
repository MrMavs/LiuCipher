LiuCipher (LC) is a security protocol.

This software is implemented in Python. It allows two nodes to establish a shared private key over an open network -- try it out!

LC aims to be the new standard for encryption. **_Assuming it cannot be cracked_**, it is better than other protocols in the following ways:

* It uses randomly generated keys, meaning **no amount of computational power can decipher intercepted messages.**
* It is symmetric (single key used to encrypt and decrypt), but unlike other symmetric ciphers; LC allows Alice and Bob to generate a key over an **insecure channel** like the web.

**Your task**, should you choose to accept it, is to crack LC. In this implementation, LC uses a psuedo-random number generator - the Mersenne Twister. Exploiting the RNG is not a true crack. A valid crack entails exploiting weakness(es) - if any - in the protocol itself.  However, any crack is interesting and worth attempting. A passive attack by signal analysis is one potential path.

To make the game **clear**, assume Alice and Bob can only communicate via Eve. Before commencing key negotiation, Alice and Bob are reasonably confident the other is whom they claim to be -- the two also share an info-theoretic-secure authenticated public channel to facilitate key reconciliation [though such channel is not in this implementation]. 

Also, Eve's computer answers NP-hard questions in P. She has full read/write capability over any transmission, and is blind to Alice / Bob's internal state.

Optimal parameter settings are: -n 1250 -tr 20
